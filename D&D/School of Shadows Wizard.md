# School of Shadows Wizard

Many look to the stars for inspiration; you, however, look to the shadows. As a member of the School of Shadows, you seek to obfuscate yourself, your actions, and sometimes your intentions.  While some find themselves suited to lie in wait using the shadows as cover, others of your ilk find the shadows a place to obtain information and seek out knowledge.  Most consider light to be a fundamental component of the Weave - practitioners of the School of Shadows know that the shadows are not merely the absence of light but are themselves alive!

## Shadow's Apprentice

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet, or gain an additional 30 feet if you already have darkvision. In addition, you gain proficiency in stealth, and you apply your proficiency modifier in any intimidation, persuasion or deception checks that rely on your use of illusion magic.

### Familiarity of Shadows

When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the spell Find Familiar. This spell is always prepared and does not count against your number of prepared spells.  You may summon a Shadow as your familiar.  In addition, your Shadow familiar can use the Help action to provide advantage on any stealth rolls you may make when in dim light or darkness.

## The Darkening Path

Knowledge, subterfuge, pain or benediction. A range of magical options become available to those that study the darkness, but not without cost. Continued use can drain a mage swiftly of their power. Beginning at sixth level, you gain Shadow Points equal to your proficiency modifier. You may spend them on chosen abilities below and regain all points after a long rest. You may also spend a spell slot at any time to regain Shadow Points equal to the level of the slot expended, up to your allowed maximum. Choose three abilities below when you gain this trait to use your Shadow Points on. Each ability costs one point per use unless otherwise noted. You gain an additional ability at levels 10 and 15 in this class. When you gain a level in this class you may also swap one ability you know for another.

### Dark Cunning

The shadows give you purpose and speed. You may reroll a dexterity or intelligence based skill check. You can do so after the roll, but before the outcome is known. You may select either result

### Shadowblur

Your form wavers. As a reaction you can force an enemy to reroll a successful attack roll against you that you can see. You cannot force the reroll of a critical hit, but neither can the reroll become one.

### Unseen Unheard

Your magic becomes apparent even before your intent is revealed. When you cast a spell, you may cast it without verbal or somatic components.

### Hidden Path

Those around you gain a sliver of the power of shadows. You may use two shadow points to cast Pass without Trace as an action. It is considered a wizard spell for you.

### Umbral Step

You move instantly and unseen. You may teleport up to 15 feet to a place you can see as a bonus action.

### Stygian Glide

Until the beginning of your next turn, your movement does not trigger opportunity attacks.

### Power Pulse

Your minor magics become accelerated. You may cast a wizard cantrip you know with a casting time of one action as a bonus action.

### Absorption

Darkness feels no pain. You may reroll a failed concentration save for a spell.

### Shadowâ€™s Disguise

As a bonus action, you can magically turn invisible for up to 1 minute or until you enter bright light, you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw.
